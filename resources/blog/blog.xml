		<title>Structure of Unix Version 7 Filesystem</title>
		<abstract>
			For the first time, the file system of the vastly influential
			version of Unix has been documented, featuring examples for locating and
			reading files.
		</abstract>
		<content>
			<paragraph>
				Research Unix version 7 was a significant step in the
				development of this operating system, introducing some of the
				more influential features that we still rely on today. Thanks to
				the release of research unix source code, a port of version 7 to
				x86 by Nordier &amp; Associates, and some code from NetBSD, I
				have been able to piece together an understanding of how the
				filesystem can be processed to located and read files.
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph>
				I was motivated to do this, as based on the source code for the
				superblock, and the man files from version 7, it appeared that
				the unix filesystem could be considered a highly simplified
				variant of the extended file system used by Linux. The goal is
				to use these studies as a stepping stone towards understanding
				the extended file system. The Unix file system is conventionally
				limited to about 150MiB, which is not practical in the modern
				era.
